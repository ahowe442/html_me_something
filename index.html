            I believe that art can transform lives and make the world a better place. My mission is to inspire and serve
            the world’s artists and art educators by providing them with support, resources and opportunity. I intend to
            provide the art community with technology that is simple to use, empowering and beautiful. To that end I’m
            passionate about ensuring a positive impact for the people who make the world a better place.
            My desire is to work with a product–development team to build new functionality into our products and be
            creative the solutions created. I have a new found interest in user-interface design & experience, abd
            integrating web-services. I am eager to solve some hard problems in these areas.

            I am looking forward to contributing the teams. I work well with minimal supervision and am comfortable with
            working on various layers of a complex system powering thousands of websites. I am able to provide my best
            work in environments which are creative, relaxed and highly collaborative.
